/* A circular buffer queue is designed to minimze the asymptotic complexity
 of queueing and dequeueing elemetnts. 
 
 An Array stores the elements in the queue and when enqueueing, an element is
 written at the "write" index, which is then advanced, wrapping around if
 needed. When dequeueing, an element is read from the "read" index, which is
 then advanced, wrapping around if needed.
 
 The queue is initialized with a certain capacity, and if the user attempts to
 enqueue more elements than the capacity, the array is resized to support it.
